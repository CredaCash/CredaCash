(clarification of source code copyright provenance)

The x86-64 assembly language code is taken directly from the SCIPR Lab's libsnark
project. This code appears in files: AsmMacros.hpp, BigInt.hpp, FpModel.tcc . Any
modifications are insignificant. It is essentially the original code in libsnark
and not a derived work.

The C++ language code is a derived work. The original work is under copyright of
the SCIPR Lab. Both original and derived works are under the MIT License which
permits derivative works so long as the chain of copyright notices is maintained.
