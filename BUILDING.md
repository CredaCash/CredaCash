# Building the CredaCash&trade; Software

<!--- NOTE: This file is in Markdown format, and is intended to be viewed in a Markdown viewer. -->

Windows executables are available at [CredaCash.com](https://CredaCash.com/software/).  The following steps are only needed to build the software for Linux, or to rebuild for Windows from source.

## Supported Platforms

The CredaCash software is intended to be cross-platform, and has been built and run under 64-bit versions of Windows and Linux (specifically, Windows 7 x64, Debian Buster v10.1 amd64, and the most recent Amazon Linux 2 AMI 64-bit x86 for Amazon EC2, and earlier versions of the CredaCash software have been tested with Debian Stretch v9.8 amd64 and with the official Ubuntu v18.04 arm64 distribution for the ODROID-C2 single board ARM computer).  Compatibility with other platforms is unknown.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required.  Specific instructions are provided below for Debian Linux and Windows x64.

Required to fetch the source dependencies:

- curl
- unzip
- Python (any version, however Python 2.7.x 64-bit is required to run the test scripts)

Required to build:

- GNU g++ v4.8 or higher.  The software has been specifically tested with v4.9.4, v6.4.0, v7.3.1 and v8.3.0.  The earlier version works just as well as the more recent versions.  Under Linux, the default version provided with your distribution is recommended.
- Boost library, roughly version v1.54 or higher.  The software has been specifically tested with v1.62, v1.67 and v1.70.  Under Linux, the version provided with your distribution is recommended, if it is compatible.
- GNU gmplib, any recent version.  Under Linux, the version provided with your distribution is recommended, if it is compatible.

Required to run:

- Tor v0.3.2 or higher

Required to run the test scripts:

- Python 2.7.x 64-bit

## Linux

The following instructions are specifically for Debian 10.  They may be adaptable to other Linux distributions.

1. Install the following packages:

	- curl
	- unzip
	- make
	- g++
	- libboost-all-dev
	- libgmp-dev

	Note that in Redhat-based distribtions, the above packages are named curl, unzip, make, gcc-c++, boost-devel, and gmp-devel

2. Tor v0.3.2 or higher is required to run CredaCash.  The Tor source code is available at the [Tor Distribution site](https://dist.torproject.org/), and build instruction for Linux can be found at the [Tor website](https://2019.www.torproject.org/docs/tor-doc-unix.html.en). 

	For Debian 10, simply install the tor package.  For earlier Debian versions, Tor v0.3.2+ is available in the backports repository.  If the backports repository has not yet been enabled, it can be enabled with:

	``sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch-backports.list"``

	``sudo apt-get update``

	Tor v0.3.2+ can then be installed with:

	``sudo apt-get -t stretch-backports install tor``

	``sudo systemctl stop tor``

	``sudo systemctl disable tor``

3. Open a new terminal window and fetch the CredaCash source code:

	``mkdir CredaCash``

	``cd CredaCash``

	``curl -L https://github.com/CredaCash/CredaCash/archive/master.zip -o credacash_source.zip``

	``unzip credacash_source.zip``

	``mv CredaCash-master/* .``

	``rmdir CredaCash-master``

	``rm *.bat``

	``chmod +x *.sh``

4. Fetch the dependencies:

	``./get_depends.sh``

5. Fetch the genesis files:

	``./get_genesis.sh``

6. Fetch the zero knowledge proof keys:

	``./get_zkkeys.sh``

7. Build the executables:

	``./make_release.sh``

	This should build the network node server (ccnode.exe), wallet server (ccwallet.exe) and transaction library (cctx64.dll) and place them into the current directory.

#### Boost

If the build is not successful due to incompatibilities with Boost, Boost can be built from source as static libraries under Linux as follows:

1. Download the latest stable version of the Boost library source code from [boost.org](https://www.boost.org/)

2. Extract to CredaCash/depends/boost

3. Check that the directory CredaCash/depends/boost contains the subdirectories boost, doc, libs, etc.

4. From a command prompt, run the following commands:

	``cd CredaCash/depends/boost``

	``./bootstrap.sh``

	``./b2 --layout=system --ignore-site-config --without-python cflags=-fPIC variant=release threading=multi link=static runtime-link=shared``

	The output should be "The Boost C++ Libraries were successfully built!"

5. The CredaCash executables can then be built using the static boost libraries as follows:

	``cd CredaCash``

	``./make_clean.sh``

	``./make_release.sh static-boost``

## Windows x64

Windows executables are available at [CredaCash.com](https://CredaCash.com/software/).  The following steps are only needed to rebuild the executables from source.
