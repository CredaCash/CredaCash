# Building the CredaCash&trade; Software

<!--- NOTE: This file is in Markdown format, and is intended to be viewed in a Markdown viewer. -->

Windows executables are available at [CredaCash.com](https://CredaCash.com/software/).  The following steps are only needed to build the software for Linux, or to rebuild for Windows from source.

## Supported Platforms

The CredaCash software is intended to be cross-platform, and has been built and run under 64-bit versions of Windows and 64-bit little-endian versions of Linux.  Compatibility with other platforms is unknown.

## Dependencies

The following dependencies are required.  Specific instructions are provided below for Debian Linux and Windows x64.

Required to fetch the source dependencies:

- curl
- unzip
- Python (v2.7, or v3.8 or higher)

Required to build:

- GNU g++ v4.8 or higher.  The CredaCash software has been tested with g++ up to v12.2.  The earlier versions work just as well as the more recent versions.  Under Linux, the default version provided with your distribution is recommended.
- Boost library, version 1.81 or earlier, but no earlier than version v1.66.  Under Linux, the version provided with your distribution is recommended, if it is compatible.
- GNU gmplib, any recent version.  Under Linux, the version provided with your distribution is recommended, if it is compatible.

Required to run:

- Tor v0.3.2 or higher

## Linux

The following instructions are specifically for Debian 10.  They may be adaptable to other Linux distributions.

1. Install the following packages:

		sudo apt-get install curl unzip make g++ libboost-all-dev libgmp-dev

	Note that in Redhat-based distributions, the above packages are named:

		sudo yum install curl unzip make gcc-c++ boost-devel gmp-devel

2. Tor v0.3.2 or higher is required to run CredaCash.  For Debian 10, simply install the tor package.  For earlier Debian versions, Tor v0.3.2+ is available in the backports repository.  If the backports repository has not yet been enabled, it can be enabled with:

		sudo sh -c "echo 'deb http://deb.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main' >> /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch-backports.list"
		sudo apt-get update

	Tor v0.3.2+ can then be installed with:

		sudo apt-get -t stretch-backports install tor
		sudo systemctl stop tor
		sudo systemctl disable tor

	It is also possible to build Tor from source.  The source code is available at the [Tor Distribution site](https://dist.torproject.org/).  You may need to also first install:
	
		sudo apt-get install libevent-dev libssl-dev libzstd-dev libsystemd-dev
		
	or in a Redhat-based distribution:
	
		sudo yum install libevent-devel openssl-devel libzstd-devel systemd-devel
		
	Tor can then be built using the commands:

		./configure --enable-systemd --disable-module-relay --disable-unittests
		make
		sudo make install

	Note that --enable-systemd can be omitted if your environment does not use systemd.

3. Open a new terminal window and fetch the CredaCash source code:

		mkdir CredaCash
		cd CredaCash
		curl -L https://github.com/CredaCash/CredaCash/archive/master.zip -o credacash_source.zip
		unzip credacash_source.zip
		mv CredaCash-master/* .
		rmdir CredaCash-master
		rm *.bat
		chmod +x *.sh

4. Check that the command "python" will run Python:

		python --version

	If this command does not report the Python version, then run the command:

		sudo ln /usr/bin/python3 /usr/bin/python

	or, if you are using Python v2.7, run the command:

		sudo ln /usr/bin/python2 /usr/bin/python

	and then recheck that "python --version" works.

5. Fetch the dependencies:

		./get_depends.sh

6. Fetch the genesis files:

		./get_genesis.sh

7. Fetch the zero knowledge proof keys:

		./get_zkkeys.sh

8. Build the executables:

		./make_release.sh

	This should build the network node server (ccnode.exe) and wallet server (ccwallet.exe) and place them into the current directory.

#### Boost

If the build is not successful due to incompatibilities with Boost, Boost can be built from source as static libraries under Linux as follows:

1. Download version 1.81 or earlier of the Boost library source code from [boost.org](https://www.boost.org/).

2. Extract the Boost source code to CredaCash/depends/boost

3. Check that the directory CredaCash/depends/boost contains the subdirectories boost, doc, libs, etc.

4. From a command prompt, run the following commands:

		cd CredaCash/depends/boost
		./bootstrap.sh
		./b2 --layout=system --ignore-site-config --without-python cflags=-fPIC variant=release threading=multi link=static runtime-link=shared

	The output should be "The Boost C++ Libraries were successfully built!"

5. The CredaCash executables can then be built using the static boost libraries as follows:

		cd CredaCash
		./make_clean.sh
		./make_release.sh static-boost

### Python Requests Module

CredaCash's Python scripts require the Python requests module which can be installed as follows:

	python -m ensurepip --upgrade
	python -m pip install requests

## Windows x64

Windows executables are available at [CredaCash.com](https://CredaCash.com/software/).  The following steps are only needed to rebuild the executables from source.

### Set up the environment

2. Extract it to C:\CredaCash

3. Check that C:\CredaCash contains the subdirectories source and test.

4. Open a command prompt and execute:

		cd C:\CredaCash
		set_path.bat

5. Add the directories containing curl.exe and unzip.exe to the PATH:

		set PATH=%PATH%;<directory containing curl.exe>;<directory containing unzip.exe>

6. Check that curl.exe is in your path by executing:

		curl --version

	This should print the curl version.

7. Check that unzip.exe is in your path by executing:
