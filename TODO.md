# CredaCash&trade; To Do List

### Needed for First Production Release

-	A mechanism to collect user donations paid to the witnesses that assemble the blockchain.
-	Currently, the nodes on the network only partially validate transactions that have already been placed into blocks.  This needs to be changed to fully validate transactions inside blocks.

### Future Wish List

-	Wallets for Android and iOS smartphones.
-	A wallet-to-wallet communication protocol to help eliminate misdirected payments.
-	Allow anyone to setup their own public or private blockchain with payments seamlessly routed from source to destination blockchain.
-	Additional features to manage the network, such as adding and removing witnesses, and adjusting the witness donation and proof-of-work required for a transaction.
-	Implement a faster blockchain protocol (that has already been developed and tested in simulations) where witnesses vote concurrently instead of sequentially.  This protocol can scale to hundreds or thousands of simultaneous witnesses.
-	Support for a proof-of-stake blockchain with automated processes for witnesses to join or be removed.
